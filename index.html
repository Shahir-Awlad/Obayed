            <p class="descripion">
                A man of many talents and wonder who is unlike anyone you have ever seen. His beautiul mind is capable of many things that will leave many shocked. His talents range from extreme laziness to being a hyper active nuisance. But be very warned. His docile looks does not mean he is incapable of harm. He is the most ferocious being on this planet.

                He is more than just a man. He is a beast which can harness 100 percent of a form of energy called sugar energy. Once in this "beast" mode, he can have unlimited energy and practically no shame whatsoever. He can give room tours for days (or until the sugar runs out). I once encountered this "beast mode" live.

            <h2>Happiness</h1>
                <p class="notedes">More often than not he is a happy guy who does not let the outside world bother him. He is happy go lucky type of guy that everyone loves to hangs. Someone whom you can joke with without the fear of him getting offended.</p>

            <h2>Anger</h2>
            <p class="notedes">However! If you have managed to offend him in any way or form, or if you are rawfin, then you are in a world of pain. He will argue with logic pulled straight from the depths of his fat ass. He will fight till he can't breath anymore and will not forgive. The main solution to this problem is to just let him be for 2-3 business days.</p>
